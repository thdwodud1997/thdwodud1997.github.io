My research interests broadly cover mechanism design and end-to-end robotics development.  
I have experience in areas such as mobile manipulators, deployable mechanisms, and biomimetic robots.  
I am also interested in other areas of robot development, including wearable devices, reconfigurable modular robots, actuator development, and sergical robots.

Utilized the extendable robotic arm as a mobile manipulator. It was effectively integrated into a robot slightly larger than a robotic vacuum cleaner, featuring a 2m reach and a 1kg payload. The issue of excessive moment force caused by the long moment arm was primarily addressed during the research.<br>

Developed a compact and rigid extendable robotic arm. Its rigidity allows it to serve as a frame for deployable structures, acting as a key component in various deployable structure designs. A self-deployable tetrahedron frame, 3.4m tall and capable of 3D printing a 2.5m object was demonstrated.<br>

- _2020.08 - 2022.02_, __Research Internship: Hopping Robot Development__<br>
Conducted independent research on developing an energy-efficient untethered hopping robot. An integrated energy-storing spring stored and released energy, enabling the robot to jump with minimal actuator input. As an actuator mechanism design, a series elastic actuator was connected to the energy-storing spring through an active clutch.<br>
