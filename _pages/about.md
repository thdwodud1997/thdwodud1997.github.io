<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My research interests broadly cover mechanism design and end-to-end robotics development.  
I have experience in areas such as mobile manipulators, deployable mechanisms, and biomimetic robots.  
I am also interested in other areas of robot development, including wearable devices, reconfigurable modular robots, actuator development, and sergical robots.
