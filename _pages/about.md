<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My research interests broadly cover mechanism design and end-to-end robotics development.  
I have experience in areas such as mobile manipulators, deployable mechanisms, and biomimetic robots.  
I am also interested in other areas of robot development, including wearable devices, reconfigurable modular robots, actuator development, and sergical robots.

# üîß Projects
- _2023.07 - now_, __Graduate Research: Extendable Arm as a Mobile Manipulator__<br>
Utilized the extendable robotic arm as a mobile manipulator. It was effectively integrated into a robot slightly larger than a robotic vacuum cleaner, featuring a 2m reach and a 1kg payload. The issue of excessive moment force caused by the long moment arm was primarily addressed during the research.<br>

- _2022.04 - now_, __Graduate Research: Extendable Robotic Arm__<br>

  Developed a compact and rigid extendable robotic arm. Its rigidity allows it to serve as a frame for deployable structures, acting as a key component in various deployable structure designs. A self-deployable tetrahedron frame, 3.4m tall and capable of 3D printing a 2.5m object was demonstrated.<br>

- _2023.07 - 2024.01_, __Graduate Student Startup CTO: Anti-tremor Glove Development__<br>
<img src="assets/images/Antreon_device_image.jpg" alt="Antreon Device Image" width="600"><br>
Served as CTO for a graduate student-led startup, developing a hand tremor suppression glove using gyroscopic principles. The device was intended for distribution to local patients in collaboration with the local government. User evaluations were conducted during development, and feedback was incorporated to improve the device.<br>

- _2020.08 - 2022.02_, __Undergraduate Research Internship: Hopping Robot Development__<br>

Conducted independent research on developing an energy-efficient untethered hopping robot. An integrated energy-storing spring stored and released energy, enabling the robot to jump with minimal actuator input. As an actuator mechanism design, a series elastic actuator was connected to the energy-storing spring through an active clutch.<br>

- _2020.09 - 2020.12_, __Undergraduate Course Team Project: Sign Language Sensing Glove Development__<br>
Developed a sign language sensing glove for a Mechatronics course team project and got an A+ for the course.<br>
